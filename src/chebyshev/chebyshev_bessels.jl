# Piecewise-Chebyshev special-function core for Helmholtz boundary integral
# operators in 2D.
#
# This file provides reusable plan construction and evaluation routines for
#
#     H_ν^(κ)(k r),   J_ν(k r),
#
# where r≥0 is a geometric distance and k may be real or complex.
#
# The special-function layer is separated from geometry and matrix assembly:
#
#     geometry             -> distances, panel lookup, local coordinates,
#     special functions    -> Hankel/Bessel Chebyshev interpolation,
#     operator assembly    -> DLP, DLP-Kress, CFIE-Kress, Alpert, etc.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CHEBYSHEV REPRESENTATIONS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Two plan families are used:
#
# 1. ChebHankelPlanH
#
#        H_ν^(κ)(k r),
#
#    an unscaled piecewise-Chebyshev representation of the physical Hankel
#    function. It supports real and complex k and is shared by the ordinary
#    DLP, DLP-Kress, CFIE-Kress, and Alpert pathways.
#
# 2. ChebJPlan
#
#        J_ν(k r),
#
#    an unscaled piecewise-Chebyshev representation of the Bessel-J function.
#    These plans are needed by the Kress logarithmic split. For complex k,
#    J_ν(k r) must be evaluated independently and cannot in general be replaced
#    by real(H_ν^(1)(k r)).
#
# Each radial interval [rmin,rmax] is divided into uniform panels. On every
# panel [a,b], the special function is interpolated at Chebyshev-Lobatto nodes
#
#     t_j=cos(πj/M),   j=0,...,M,
#
# mapped to
#
#     r_j=(a+b)/2+(b-a)t_j/2.
#
# Evaluation uses the stored Chebyshev coefficients and Clenshaw recurrence.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SMALL-ARGUMENT STRATEGY
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Hankel functions are singular at z=k r=0, so very small arguments are not
# handled solely by polynomial interpolation.
#
# The evaluation hierarchy is
#
#     |z| < hankel_z_chebyshev_cutoff_small_z
#         -> explicit small-z H₀/H₁ series,
#
#     hankel_z_chebyshev_cutoff_small_z ≤ |z|
#       < hankel_z_chebyshev_cutoff
#         -> direct special-function evaluation,
#
#     otherwise
#         -> Chebyshev interpolation.
#
# Higher-level geometry caches may additionally use
#
#     pidx==0
#
# to indicate that a distance lies below the interpolated Hankel interval.
# Such entries are evaluated by the direct/low-z fallback rather than by a
# Chebyshev panel.
#
# This is particularly useful for quadratures such as Alpert correction rules,
# where some auxiliary off-grid distances can become very small.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PANELIZATION AND GEOMETRIC PRECOMPUTATION
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# For an interpolated radius r, the geometry layer stores
#
#     pidx    panel index,
#     t       local Chebyshev coordinate in [-1,1].
#
# The helpers
#
#     panel_indices
#     precompute_geom
#     panel_and_geom
#
# precompute these k-independent quantities. Uniform panels allow O(1) lookup
#
#     p=floor((r-rmin)/dr)+1.
#
# For compatibility with existing matrix-assembly code, `precompute_geom` and
# `panel_and_geom` continue to return
#
#     invsqrt=1/sqrt(r)
#
# in addition to the panel data. The current unscaled Hankel representation does
# not require this factor, but retaining it avoids changing established caller
# interfaces in the Kress and related Chebyshev backends.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MULTI-k EVALUATION
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Boundary-integral assembly frequently evaluates one fixed distance r for many
# wavenumbers k_m. The multi-k evaluators therefore fill preallocated buffers
# without allocation inside the matrix-entry loops.
#
# Core evaluators include
#
#     eval_h_multi_ks!
#     eval_j_multi_ks!
#     h0_h1_multi_ks_at_r!
#     h0_h1_j0_j1_multi_ks_at_r!
#     h1_j1_multi_ks_at_r!
#     h1_multi_ks_at_r!
#
# The required special functions depend on the operator:
#
#     ordinary DLP value          H₁
#     ordinary DLP derivatives    H₀,H₁ (and currently H₂ by recurrence)
#     DLP-Kress value             H₁,J₁
#     DLP-Kress derivatives       H₀,H₁,J₀,J₁
#     CFIE-Kress                  H₀,H₁,J₀,J₁.
#
# For the ordinary DLP value path, `h1_multi_ks_at_r!` and `h1_at_r` are thin
# wrappers around the same unscaled Hankel evaluator used elsewhere.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THREADING / PERFORMANCE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Chebyshev tables are constructed independently panel-by-panel and therefore
# use threading. Vectorized geometry and evaluation routines are also threaded
# where appropriate.
#
# The dominant costs are generally controlled by
#
#     number of radial panels,
#     Chebyshev degree per panel,
#     number of special-function families,
#     number of matrix-entry evaluations.
#
# The low-z switching branch is negligible compared with direct Hankel/Bessel
# evaluation or a Clenshaw recurrence.

Evaluate `H₀^(1)`, `H₁^(1)`, `J₀`, and `J₁` for all wavenumbers at one fixed
distance panel/location, writing the results in place.

This function is the small inner evaluator used by the multi-`k` same-component
CFIE-Kress assembly. The geometric pair `(i,j)` has already been mapped to:
- a Chebyshev panel index `pidx`,
- a local coordinate `t ∈ [-1,1]`.

For each wavenumber `k_m`, the function interpolates:
- `H₀^(1)(k_m r)`
- `H₁^(1)(k_m r)`
- `J₀(k_m r)`
- `J₁(k_m r)`

by evaluating the corresponding Chebyshev expansions with Clenshaw recurrence.
For real wavenumbers one may sometimes identify `J_n` with `real(H_n^(1))`,
but for complex `k` that is not valid. The Kress split formulas genuinely
require `J₀` and `J₁`, so they are interpolated separately.

# Arguments

  Output vector for the `H₀^(1)` values.

Chebyshev pathway. The geometric pair `(i,j)` has already been mapped to:

- and the physical distance `r`.

For the interpolated regime, the function evaluates:

and then recovers `H₂^(1)(k r)` by the recurrence

    plans0::AbstractVector{ChebHankelPlanH},plans1::AbstractVector{ChebHankelPlanH},pidx::Int32,t::Float64,r::Float64)

Evaluate `H₀^(1)`, `H₁^(1)`, and `H₂^(1)` for all wavenumbers at one fixed
distance panel/location, writing the results in place.

This is the reduced special-function evaluator used by the multi-`k` derivative
DLP Chebyshev assembly. The geometric pair `(i,j)` has already been mapped to:
- a Chebyshev panel index `pidx`,
- a local coordinate `t ∈ [-1,1]`,
- and the physical distance `r`.

For each wavenumber `k_m`, the function evaluates:
- `H₀^(1)(k_m r)`,
- `H₁^(1)(k_m r)`,

and then recovers `H₂^(1)(k_m r)` by the recurrence

    H₂^(1)(z) = (2/z) H₁^(1)(z) - H₀^(1)(z),

except in the small-argument regime, where it switches to series or direct
evaluation to avoid loss of accuracy.

# Arguments
- `h0vals::AbstractVector{ComplexF64}`:
  Output vector for the `H₀^(1)` values.
- `h1vals::AbstractVector{ComplexF64}`:
  Output vector for the `H₁^(1)` values.
- `h2vals::AbstractVector{ComplexF64}`:
  Output vector for the `H₂^(1)` values.
- `plans0::AbstractVector{ChebHankelPlanH}`:
  Chebyshev plans for `H₀^(1)`.
- `plans1::AbstractVector{ChebHankelPlanH}`:
  Chebyshev plans for `H₁^(1)`.
- `pidx::Int32`:
  Panel index containing the current distance. If `pidx==0`, the evaluation is
  taken from the near-zero patch instead of the Chebyshev panels.
- `t::Float64`:
  Local Chebyshev coordinate in the active panel.
- `r::Float64`:
  Distance at which to evaluate the Hankel functions.

# Returns
- `nothing`
