    evaluate_points(solver::AcceleratedBIMSolver, billiard::Bi, k) where {Bi<:AbsBilliard} → pts::BoundaryPoints

Samples the boundary of `billiard` by delegating to `solver.kernel`'s own
`evaluate_points` method.

## Description
Every concrete [`AcceleratedBIMSolver`](@ref) ([`BeynSolver`](@ref),
[`ExpandedBIMSolver`](@ref)) wraps an inner `kernel::SweepBIMSolver` supplying
the Fredholm operator; the boundary discretization itself is entirely
determined by that kernel; the accelerated solver only adds a root-finding
strategy on top of `construct_matrices`/`solve`.

## Arguments
* `solver`: The [`AcceleratedBIMSolver`](@ref) whose wrapped kernel determines the boundary discretization.
* `billiard`: The billiard whose boundary is discretized.
* `k`: The wavenumber used to determine the number of boundary sampling points.

## Returns
* `pts`: A [`BoundaryPoints`](@ref) instance, as produced by `evaluate_points(solver.kernel, billiard, k)`.

    solve_wavenumber(solver::AcceleratedBasisSolver, basis::AbsBasis, billiard::AbsBilliard, k, dk; multithreaded::Bool = true) → (k0, t0)

Finds the eigenvalue candidate `k0` closest to the target wavenumber `k`, together
with its associated tension `t0`, among the eigenvalues found by an accelerated
`solver` in a single diagonalization near `k`.

## Description
The basis dimension is scaled with the boundary length and wavenumber via
`solver.dim_scaling_factor` (bounded below by `solver.min_dim`), the basis is
resized to this dimension with [`resize_basis`](@ref), boundary points are
generated with [`evaluate_points`](@ref), and the accelerated eigenvalue problem is
solved with [`solve`](@ref) to obtain candidate wavenumbers `ks` and tensions `ts`
within the window `dk` of `k`. The candidate closest to `k` is returned.

## Arguments
* `solver`: The [`AcceleratedBasisSolver`](@ref) used to solve the eigenvalue problem.
* `basis`: The basis used to approximate the eigenstates.
* `billiard`: The billiard whose boundary is discretized.
* `k`: The target wavenumber around which the search is performed.
* `dk`: Half-width of the wavenumber window around `k`.

## Keyword arguments
* `multithreaded::Bool = true`: Whether the matrix construction is multithreaded.

## Returns
* `k0`: The candidate wavenumber closest to `k`.
* `t0`: The tension associated with `k0`.
