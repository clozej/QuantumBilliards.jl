    ChebyshevConfig{T<:Real}

Bundles every tunable parameter controlling Chebyshev-interpolated
Hankel/Bessel-J kernel evaluation into a single configuration object, instead
of scattering `n_panels_h`/`M_h`/`n_panels_j`/`M_j`/`cheb_tol`/... across many
keyword arguments the way `QuantumBilliards-develop` does. A `ChebyshevConfig`
is stored as the `cheb_config` field of every [`AcceleratedBIMSolver`](@ref)
(`BeynSolver`, `ExpandedBIMSolver`), so it can be constructed once and reused
across an entire [`compute_spectrum`](@ref) sweep.

## Attributes
* `n_panels_h::Int`: Hankel-function Chebyshev panel count.
* `M_h::Int`: Hankel-function Chebyshev polynomial degree per panel.
* `n_panels_j::Int`: Bessel-J-function Chebyshev panel count.
* `M_j::Int`: Bessel-J-function Chebyshev polynomial degree per panel.
* `tol::T`: Target absolute error used by the auto-tuning routine when growing panel counts/degrees.
* `max_iter::Int`: Maximum number of auto-tuning iterations.
* `sampling_points::Int`: Number of radial validation points used during auto-tuning.
* `grow_panels::T`: Multiplicative panel-count growth factor during auto-tuning.
* `grow_M::Int`: Additive polynomial-degree growth during auto-tuning.
* `param_strategy::Symbol`: One of `:global`, `:segment` or `:manual`, controlling how often the panelization is retuned across a wide sweep.

!!! note "Chebyshev acceleration"
    The Chebyshev interpolation machinery (panel construction, coefficient
    fitting, auto-tuning, Chebyshev-accelerated `construct_matrices`) lives in
    `solvers/chebyshev/` and is used by [`BeynSolver`](@ref)/
    [`ExpandedBIMSolver`](@ref) whenever `use_chebyshev=true`, for
    [`DoubleLayerPotentialSolver`](@ref)/[`CombinedFieldIntegralEquationSolver`](@ref)
    kernels with `T===Float64` (a [`CompositeBIMSolver`](@ref) kernel or a
    non-`Float64` numeric type raises an error; construct with
    `use_chebyshev=false` instead).
