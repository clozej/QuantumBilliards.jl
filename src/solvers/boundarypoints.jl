    BoundaryPoints{T} <: Any

`BoundaryPoints` is a concrete type that collects the boundary discretization data
(sampled points, normals, arc-length coordinates and quadrature weights) used by
the solvers to construct the boundary matrices.

## Description
Instances are produced either by [`boundary_coords`](@ref), which samples the full
boundary (including curves marked with `QuantumSolverIgnore`) to compute `xy`,
`normal`, `s` and `ds`, or by a solver's `evaluate_points` method, which samples
only the physical boundary and computes solver-specific quadrature weights such as
`w_vs` (see [`VerginiSaracenoSolver`](@ref)) or `w_dm` (see
[`DecompositionMethodSolver`](@ref)). Fields that are not populated by a given
constructor call default to empty vectors. The inner constructor validates that
all non-empty vector fields have the same length as `xy`.

## Attributes
* `xy`: Boundary points in Cartesian coordinates.
* `normal`: Outward unit normal vectors at each boundary point.
* `kappa`: Curvature of the boundary at each point (reserved, currently unused).
* `s`: Arc-length coordinate of each boundary point, measured continuously along the full composite boundary.
* `ds`: Arc-length quadrature element at each boundary point.
* `rdotn`: Dot product of the position vector with the normal, `r ⋅ n` (reserved, currently unused).
* `w_vs`: Quadrature weights for the Vergini–Saraceno method, see [`VerginiSaracenoSolver`](@ref).
* `w_dm`: Quadrature weights for the decomposition method, see [`DecompositionMethodSolver`](@ref).
* `xy_int`: Interior points (reserved, currently unused).

Fields added for boundary-integral/Kress-type discretizations (populated only
by [`SweepBIMSolver`](@ref)/[`AcceleratedBIMSolver`](@ref) `evaluate_points`
methods): `w`, `w_n`, `curvature`, `shift_x`, `shift_y`, `tangent`,
`tangent_2`, `ts`, `tphys`, `ws`, `ws_der`, `compid`, `is_periodic`, `xL`,
`xR`, `tL`, `tR`. These default to empty vectors/neutral scalars and are
otherwise unused by the basis solvers (`kappa`/`rdotn`/`w_vs`/`w_dm` are
unaffected).

## API
The following functions can be evaluated for this type:
- [`boundary_coords`](@ref)
- [`boundary_matrix_size`](@ref)
- [`boundary_s`](@ref)
- [`component_offsets`](@ref)
- `Base.length`
