    ParticularSolutionsMethod{T} <: SweepBasisSolver

`ParticularSolutionsMethod` is a concrete [`SweepBasisSolver`](@ref)
implementing the particular solutions method (PSM) for computing quantum
billiard spectra by sweeping over individual wavenumbers.

## Description
For a fixed wavenumber `k`, the method constructs the basis matrices `B`
(boundary) and `B_int` (interior) (see [`construct_matrices`](@ref)) from a
boundary quadrature and a set of random interior points (see
[`evaluate_points`](@ref)), and defines the tension from the smallest singular
value of `B` normalized against `B_int` (see [`solve`](@ref)). A sequence of
tensions over a range of wavenumbers is minimized/scanned by
[`solve_wavenumber`](@ref) or [`k_sweep`](@ref), inherited from
[`SweepBasisSolver`](@ref), to locate the eigenvalues of the billiard.

## Attributes
* `dim_scaling_factor`: Scaling factor used to determine the basis dimension from the boundary length and wavenumber.
* `pts_scaling_factor`: Vector of scaling factors, one per fundamental boundary curve, used to determine the number of boundary sampling points.
* `int_pts_scaling_factor`: Scaling factor used to determine the number of interior sampling points.
* `sampler`: Vector of samplers, one per fundamental boundary curve, used to generate boundary points.
* `eps`: Relative tolerance used to filter small singular values.
* `min_dim`: Minimum basis dimension.
* `min_pts`: Minimum number of boundary sampling points.
* `min_int_pts`: Minimum number of interior sampling points.

## API
The following functions can be evaluated for this type:
- [`evaluate_points`](@ref)

Computes the particular solutions method tension at wavenumber `k` using a
rank-reduced singular value decomposition of `B`/`B_int` for improved
performance at large basis dimension.

## Description
`B_int` is factorized with a rank-revealing pivoted QR, `B_int * P = Q * R`.
Only the numerically well-determined leading `r × r` block of `R` (with `r`
determined by [`_numerical_rank_from_F`](@ref) and `tol`) is used to reduce `B`
via a stable triangular solve, after which the tension is the square root of
the smallest eigenvalue of the small `r × r` matrix `B_reduced' * B_reduced`.
This avoids ever forming the full generalized SVD of `(B, B_int)`.

* `solver`: The [`ParticularSolutionsMethod`](@ref) used to solve the eigenvalue problem.
* `basis`: The basis used to approximate the eigenstate.
* `pts`: The [`BoundaryPoints`](@ref) with sampled boundary/interior points.
* `k`: The wavenumber at which the tension is evaluated.

## Keyword arguments
* `multithreaded::Bool = true`: Whether the matrix construction is multithreaded.
* `tol::Real = 1e-10`: Relative tolerance used to determine the numerical rank of `B_int`'s QR factorization. Should increase with `k` since `R[1,1]` decreases with `k`.

Same rank-revealing QR reduction of `B_int` as
