search window with `Optim.optimize`.

## Arguments
* `solver`: The [`SweepBasisSolver`](@ref) used to solve for the tension at each wavenumber.
* `basis`: The basis used to approximate the eigenstate.
* `billiard`: The billiard whose boundary is discretized.
* `k`: The center of the wavenumber search window.
* `dk`: Width of the wavenumber search window, `[k - dk/2, k + dk/2]`.

## Keyword arguments

Generic across every [`AbsBIMSolver`](@ref) (`DoubleLayerPotentialSolver`,

"""
    _bim_normal_derivative(solver::AbsBIMSolver, pts::BoundaryPoints{T}, lvec::AbstractVector) where {T<:Real} → u_raw::Vector

Recovers the (unnormalized, not-yet-symmetrized) physical boundary normal
derivative `∂ₙψ` directly from the smallest *left* singular vector `lvec` of
a `SweepBIMSolver`'s primal Fredholm matrix `A(k)` (see
[`construct_matrices`](@ref)), without ever assembling a second (adjoint)
matrix or running a second Krylov solve.

## Description
Every Nyström-discretized boundary-integral operator in this package is
built from a diagonal quadrature weight `W = diag(ds)`. The physical
normal derivative is the (near-)null right singular vector of the
*weighted-transpose* adjoint operator `A_adj(k) = W⁻¹A(k)ᵀW` (a *bilinear*
transpose, not a conjugate transpose). Writing the primal SVD as
`A = UΣV*`, transposing gives `Aᵀ = V̄ΣŪ*`, i.e. `Aᵀ`'s right singular
vectors are exactly the *conjugates* of `A`'s left singular vectors
(`Aᵀ ū_j = σ_j v̄_j`, obtained by conjugating the standard relation
`A*u_j = σ_j v_j`). Consequently `y = W⁻¹ū_L` satisfies `A_adj(k) y =
W⁻¹Aᵀ(Wy) = W⁻¹Aᵀū_L = 0` exactly whenever `Aᵀū_L = 0` exactly (i.e. at a
true eigenvalue), and is an equally good approximation away from it as the
tension `A`'s own smallest singular value provides — the same accuracy
[`solve_vect`](@ref)'s density already carries. This lets
[`solve_state`](@ref) recover `u_L` (the primal problem's left singular
vector) from the *same* `KrylovKit.svdsolve` call already computing the
tension/density, instead of a separate adjoint-matrix assembly and solve.

Defined generically here (not per concrete solver) because this reciprocity
is a property of the underlying Helmholtz Nyström discretization shared by
every `AbsBIMSolver`, not of any one kernel. A future solver whose quadrature
weighting does not follow the plain `W = diag(ds)` convention should add its
own `_bim_normal_derivative` method instead of relying on this default.

## Returns
*  `u_raw` : The raw (fundamental-domain-length if `solver.symmetry !== nothing`) `∂ₙψ`, not yet symmetry-expanded or Rellich-normalized.

Solves the boundary-integral eigenvalue problem at wavenumber `k`, returning
everything a [`BIMEigenstate`](@ref) needs — the tension, the primal
boundary density, and the Rellich-normalized physical boundary normal
derivative `u = ∂ₙψ` on the complete physical boundary — from a *single*
`construct_matrices`/`KrylovKit.svdsolve` call, generic over every
[`SweepBIMSolver`](@ref).

## Description
`A(k)` is assembled once with [`construct_matrices`](@ref); its smallest
singular triplet is computed with one `KrylovKit.svdsolve(A, 1, :SR)` call,
giving the tension `ten`, the primal density `vec` (its right singular
vector, matching [`solve_vect`](@ref)) and, from the *same* solve, the left
singular vector used by [`_bim_normal_derivative`](@ref) to recover `∂ₙψ`
without a second matrix assembly or Krylov solve. The raw density is
expanded onto the complete physical boundary with
[`symmetrize_layer_density`](@ref) and Rellich-normalized with
[`_rellich`](@ref).

Used by [`compute_eigenstate(::SweepBIMSolver, ...)`](@ref) to populate
`BIMEigenstate`'s `vec`/`ten`/`pts`/`u`/`bnd_norm` fields up front, so
[`boundary_function`](@ref)/[`momentum_function`](@ref)/
[`husimi_function`](@ref)/[`wavefunction`](@ref) never need to re-solve
anything for a `BIMEigenstate`.

## Returns
* `ten`: The tension (smallest singular value of `A(k)`).
* `vec`: The primal boundary density (fundamental-domain length if `solver.symmetry !== nothing`).
* `u`: The Rellich-normalized `∂ₙψ` on the complete physical boundary.
* `bnd_norm`: The Rellich-identity value ([`_rellich`](@ref)) of the raw density *before* rescaling; only meaningful as the `u = u_raw/√bnd_norm` scale factor, since the raw Krylov singular vector's own norm convention carries no physical meaning by itself.
