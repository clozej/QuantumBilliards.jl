    CompositeBIMSolver{T,CS,Sy} <: SweepBIMSolver

`CompositeBIMSolver` is a concrete [`SweepBIMSolver`](@ref) for multiply
connected geometries whose connected boundary components require different
boundary-integral discretizations.

## Description
`CompositeBIMSolver` assigns one existing [`SweepBIMSolver`](@ref) component
solver (a [`DoubleLayerPotentialSolver`](@ref) or
[`CombinedFieldIntegralEquationSolver`](@ref)) to each connected physical
boundary component, assembling one globally coupled Fredholm operator. The
component solvers control only the discretization and same-component
Kress/grading quadrature of their own boundary component; inter-component
interactions are evaluated with ordinary Nyström quadrature. The first
component solver is interpreted as the outer boundary; the remaining
component solvers (`2:end`) are interpreted as holes and are
orientation-reversed after discretization.

## Attributes
* `component_solvers`: Tuple with one [`SweepBIMSolver`](@ref) per connected boundary component, outer boundary first.
* `symmetry`: Optional discrete symmetry shared by every component solver.

## API
The following functions can be evaluated for this type:
- [`evaluate_points`](@ref)
- [`construct_matrices`](@ref)
- [`solve`](@ref)
- [`solve_vect`](@ref)
- [`solve_wavenumber`](@ref)
- [`k_sweep`](@ref)

!!! note "Migration status"
    API scaffold only (struct, constructor and method signatures), generalizing
    `QuantumBilliards-develop`'s `CFIE_kress_composite_solver` to both the
    [`DoubleLayerPotentialSolver`](@ref) and
    [`CombinedFieldIntegralEquationSolver`](@ref) families. The matrix-assembly
    bodies are not yet implemented; every method below raises an `error` until
    Step 2 of the migration plan lands.
