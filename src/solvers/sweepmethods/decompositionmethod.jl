    DecompositionMethodSolver{T} <: SweepBasisSolver

`DecompositionMethodSolver` is a concrete [`SweepBasisSolver`](@ref) implementing the
boundary decomposition method for computing quantum billiard spectra by sweeping
over individual wavenumbers.

## Description
For a fixed wavenumber `k`, the method constructs the matrices `F` and `G` (see
[`construct_matrices`](@ref)) from a boundary quadrature with weights `ds` and
`w_dm` (see [`evaluate_points`](@ref)) and extracts a tension `t = 1/λ0` from the
largest generalized eigenvalue λ0 of `F * x = λ * G * x` (see [`solve`](@ref)). A
sequence of tensions over a range of wavenumbers is minimized/scanned by
[`solve_wavenumber`](@ref) or [`k_sweep`](@ref) to locate the eigenvalues of the
billiard.

## Attributes
* `dim_scaling_factor`: Scaling factor used to determine the basis dimension from the boundary length and wavenumber.
* `pts_scaling_factor`: Vector of scaling factors, one per fundamental boundary curve, used to determine the number of boundary sampling points.
* `sampler`: Vector of samplers, one per fundamental boundary curve, used to generate boundary points.
* `eps`: Relative tolerance used to filter small eigenvalues in the generalized eigenvalue decomposition.
* `min_dim`: Minimum basis dimension.
* `min_pts`: Minimum number of boundary sampling points.

## API
The following functions can be evaluated for this type:
- [`evaluate_points`](@ref)
- [`construct_matrices`](@ref)
- [`solve`](@ref)
- [`solve_vect`](@ref)
- [`solve_wavenumber`](@ref)

Samples the boundary of `billiard` and computes the boundary decomposition method
quadrature weights needed to construct the matrices in [`construct_matrices`](@ref).

## Description
The scaling factors and samplers are first adjusted to match the number of
fundamental boundary curves with [`adjust_scaling_and_samplers`](@ref). Each curve
is then sampled with its own sampler, and the normal-derivative quadrature weight
at each point is computed as `w_dm = (ds * r ⋅ n) / (2 k^2)`, where `r` is the
boundary point and `n` its outward unit normal.

## Arguments
* `solver`: The [`DecompositionMethodSolver`](@ref) used to determine the sampling parameters.

Constructs the boundary decomposition method matrices `F` and `G` used to compute

normalized by the number of basis symmetries `nsym`. Both `F` and `G` are
